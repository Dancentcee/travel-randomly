## Read articles or view pictures about beautiful places on earth,     randomly. ðŸŒŽðŸ’š
### [view website](https://travel-randomly.vercel.app/)
Made for those who want to contribute to a git repo. You can create issues (say hello, voice a feature or bugs...etc) or add links to articles or pictures of strange and beautiful places on earth.

### Contributing to links 

- Create a personal fork of the project on Github.
- Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called `origin`.
- Add the original repository as a remote called `upstream`.
- If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
- Create a new branch to work on! Branch from `master`.
    - In [app.js](app.js), add your link in quotations after a comma in the linksOfPlaces array. 
- Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
- Add or change the documentation as needed.
- Squash your commits into a single commit with git's [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase). Create a new branch if necessary.
- Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote `origin`.
- From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's `master`!
- ...
- Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from `upstream` to your local repo and delete
your extra branch(es).

And last but not least: Always write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code â€“ not what you did to the code. ðŸ™‚
